React Trello Board
In this two-day sprint you will be building a Trello clone. Trello is a popular application for managing tasks and projects, often used in agile software development. We will probably use Trello in our own project later in the course so please sign up with Trello now and explore its functionality.

In this sprint, you should aim to implement an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), i.e, a basic prototype with core functionality which can be extended at a later date. A user should be able to create and delete lists, and add, update and delete cards from each list.

Objectives
To practice Thinking in React and planning an application with more complex state

To carefully consider user interaction and to build an appealing user interface

To practice using a range of React Event Handlers

To continue to improve your CSS skills

Steps
Spend some time 'Thinking in React' and planning your component hierarchy and the shape of your state. Pen and paper are your friends!

Start by creating the stateless components you need. Either style them nicely with Bulma or write the CSS entirely yourself.

Add state into your application, hardcoding it initially.

One by one, add the user interaction features. Perhaps begin by adding create/update/delete features on a single list, and then think about allowing for extra lists to be added/deleted.

Bonus
Trello boards have lots of features - here are just a few ideas.

Add a button to allow a user to move a card up or down a list.
Allow a user to change the background color of the page.
Allow each list to have an updatable title.
Add a dropdown menu on the card to allow a user to move it from one list to another.
Allow a user to set a Due By date on each card. If the due date is in the past, visually signal that the card is overdue.
Use a library like Dragula or React Drag and Drop Library to allow a user to drag cards between lists.
